        <p>My name is Nur Sabrina Binti Asri, and I am currently pursuing a diploma in Information Management at UiTM Kedah.  
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills as before this I used to have interest in learning IT. 
            Right now, as I only learn the basic one, I realized that learning IT are not for the weak. Throughout this diploma years,
            I've been fortunate to work on several projects that sparked and also make me lost some interest while learning in this course.
            This make me realized that learning in this course especially in system subject need a lot skills of solving the IT problems.
            I am currently working on this assignment which is creating the personal website as an individual assignment for IMD318. I am hoping 
            I can create something that can be deliverable towards the people who are gonna see this website. Try to enjoy as well as you can while 
            scrolling on my website. Thank you and Have Fun!
